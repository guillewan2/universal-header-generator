A tool to generate universal headers for programming projects. It supports multiple programming languages and can be customized to fit your project's needs.

It creates the file with the header at the top, ensuring consistency across your codebase.

## Languages Supported

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Run the script with the desired parameters:

```bash
./header-gen <filename> <The description you need for your project>
```
The result is something like this:
